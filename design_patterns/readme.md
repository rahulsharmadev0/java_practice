# DESIGN PATTERNS

## What Are Design Patterns?

Design Patterns are standard solutions to common software design problems. They help in writing reusable, flexible, and maintainable code.

1. ### Creational Design Pattern

   Focus on the process of object creation or problems related to object creation.   
   Eg. Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype

2. ### Structural Design Pattern 

   Solves problems related to how classes and objects are composed/assembled to form larger structures which are efficient and flexible in nature.  
   Eg. Adapter, Bridge, Proxy

3. ### Behavioral Design Pattern

   These patterns are about how objects communicate and delegate responsibilities. They focus on interactions, control flow, and object behavior.  
   Eg. Strategy, Observer, Template, Command
