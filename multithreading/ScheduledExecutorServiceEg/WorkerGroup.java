/*
    You are given N workers who must complete their individual tasks before proceeding to the next stage together. Implement a Java program using CyclicBarrier, where:

    Each worker takes a random amount of time to complete their task.
    Once all workers finish, a "Stage Complete" message is printed before moving to the next round.
    ðŸ”¹ Requirements:
        1. Use ExecutorService to manage threads.
        2. Use CyclicBarrier to synchronize workers.
        3. Each worker should print "Worker X finished task" before waiting at the barrier.
        4. After all workers reach the barrier, print "All workers finished. Proceeding to next stage...".
